SDF Number 319 Issued at 2200Z on 15 Nov 2021

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 14/2100Z to
15/2100Z: Solar activity has been at very low levels for the past 24
hours. There are currently 2 numbered sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be very low
with a slight chance for a C-class flare on days one, two, and three (16
Nov, 17 Nov, 18 Nov).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 14/2100Z to 15/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to active levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 438 km/s at 15/2100Z. Total IMF reached 22
nT at 15/2017Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -17 nT at
15/1937Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 2753 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to active levels on days one and two (16 Nov, 17 Nov) and
quiet levels on day three (18 Nov).

Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 176 Issued at 2200Z on 25 Jun 2022

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 24/2100Z to
25/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a C1 event observed at
25/1402Z from Region 3040 (S12E16). There are currently 2 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is likely to be low with a
slight chance for an M-class flare on days one and two (26 Jun, 27 Jun)
and expected to be very low with a slight chance for a C-class flare on
day three (28 Jun).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 24/2100Z to 25/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to unsettled levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 500 km/s at 24/2342Z. Total IMF reached 13
nT at 25/1104Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -12 nT at
25/1821Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 2035 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to minor storm levels on day one (26 Jun), quiet to
unsettled levels on day two (27 Jun) and quiet to active levels on day
three (28 Jun).

SDF Number 108 Issued at 2200Z on 18 Apr 2023

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 17/2100Z to
18/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a C4 event observed at
18/1529Z from Region 3280 (S08W94). There are currently 8 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a chance for M-class flares and a slight chance for an X-class flare on
days one, two, and three (19 Apr, 20 Apr, 21 Apr).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 17/2100Z to 18/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to active levels for the past 24 hours. Solar
wind speed reached a peak of 624 km/s at 18/2033Z. Total IMF reached 19
nT at 18/1612Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached -16 nT at
18/1549Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached
a peak level of 198 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet to minor storm levels on day one (19 Apr), unsettled to
minor storm levels on day two (20 Apr) and quiet to active levels on day
three (21 Apr).

SDF Number 26 Issued at 2200Z on 26 Jan 2025

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 25/2100Z to
26/2100Z: Solar activity has been at low levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a C4 event observed at
26/1546Z from Region 3961 (S10W90). There are currently 9 numbered
sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be low with
a chance for M-class flares and a slight chance for an X-class flare on
day one (27 Jan) and expected to be low with a chance for M-class flares
on days two and three (28 Jan, 29 Jan).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 25/2100Z to 26/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet levels for the past 24 hours. Solar wind speed
reached a peak of 383 km/s at 26/0049Z.  Electrons greater than 2 MeV at
geosynchronous orbit reached a peak level of 939 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at quiet levels on days one and two (27 Jan, 28 Jan) and quiet to
unsettled levels on day three (29 Jan). Protons greater than 10 Mev have
a slight chance of crossing threshold on day one (27 Jan).
