Solar activity was very low throughout the period. Three spotted regions populated the disk at
various times during the summary period. Region 2767 (S21, L=200, class/area Hsx/120 on 26
Jul) maintained an H-type configuration through the period and was quiet and stable. Region
2768 (N26, L=111, class/area Hsx/020 on 30 Jul) formed on the disk on 28 Jul and decayed to
plage by 02 Aug. It was quiet and stable. Region 2769 (N26, L=059, class/area Axx/010 on 02
Aug) quietly rotated onto the disk.
An eruptive prominence was observed off the SE limb about midday on 31 Jul. A slow-moving
CME was subsequently observed, but was determined to not have an Earth-directed component.
No other CMEs or activity of note was observed during the summary period.
No proton events were observed at geosynchronous orbit.
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit was at normal to moderate levels
through the period.
Geomagnetic field activity was at quiet levels through midday on 02 Aug when unsettled activity
was observed due to positive polarity CH HSS influence. Solar wind observations indicated
nominal conditions through about 02/0600 UTC when a CIR, in advance of a positive polalarity
CH HSS, became evident in the data. Wind speeds increased from about 310 km/s to near 530
km/s, total field increased to 12 nT and the Bz component reached -10 nT. The geomagnetic field
reacted with mostly unsettled conditions.

Space Weather Highlights
23 November - 29 November 2020
SWPC PRF 2361
30 November 2020
Solar activity reached moderate levels. The largest event was an M4 X-ray flare from a region
just around the SE limb. Associated with the flare was a Type II radio sweep (765 km/s), a
tenflare (240 sfu) and a CME signature first observed in SOHO/LASCO C2 imagery at 29/1325
UTC. Modeling and analysis of the event suggested only the far periphery had the potential to
interact with Earth around 02 Dec.
Of the numbered regions currently on the visible disk, 2786 (S17, L=343, class/area, Cko/1000
on 25 Nov) was the largest. It produced several C-class X-ray flares as it rotated across the disk,
the strongest being a C3/Sf at 26/1253 UTC. The leader spot remained stable throughout the
reporting period while the intermediate and trailer spots exhibited frequent, but short-lived new
spot emergence.
No proton events were observed at geosynchronous orbit.
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit was at normal to high levels
throughout the reporting period, with the highest flux of 2,430 pfu observed at 23/1700 UTC.
Geomagnetic field activity ranged from quiet to unsettled. Numerous periods of weakly
enhanced Bt, combined with frequent sustained periods of southward Bz, produced periods of
unsettled conditions on 23 Nov and 25-29 Nov. 24 Nov remained quiet.
Space Weather Outlook
30 November - 26 December 2020
Solar activity is expected to be at low levels, with a chance for R1-R2 (Minor - Moderate) radio
blackouts on 30 Nov - 14 Dec, due primarily to the flare potential from a region just around the
SE limb. Very low levels are expected on 15-18 Dec and low levels are expected from 19-26
Dec.
No proton events are expected at geosynchronous orbit.
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit is expected range from moderate
to high levels. High levels are expected on 20-26 Dec while moderate levels are anticipated for
the remainder of the outlook period. All enhancements in electron flux are due to anticipated
influence from multiple, recurrent CH HSSs.
Geomagnetic field activity is expected to be at quiet to G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm levels.
Potential influence from the periphery of the 29 Nov CME may cause periods of active
conditions around 01-02 Dec. Coronal hole influence is expected to produce active conditions on
18 Dec, G1 (Minor) storm conditions on 19 Dec, and unsettled conditions as influence wanes on
20 Dec. Weak interaction with the current sheet is likely to produce unsettled conditions on
23-25 Dec. The remainder of the outlook period is expected to be quiet.

31 May 2021
Solar activity was at very low levels on 24-25 and 30 May while an increase to low levels
occurred on 26-29 May. The majority of the flare activity was from Regions 2824 (N20, L=196,
class/area Dho/250 on 27 May) and 2826 (N24, L=215, class/area Dko/280 on 27 May). The
largest flare of the period was a C9/1f at 28/2313 UTC from Region 2824. Associated with this
flare were Type II and Type IV radio sweeps along with a CME observed off the west limb in
SOHO/LASCO C2 imagery beginning at 28/2312 UTC. WSA/ENLIL modelling of the CME
showed the bulk of the plasma directed off the Sun-Earth line, however there was potential for a
glancing blow late on 01 Jun to early on 02 Jun.
A greater than 10 MeV proton event (S1-Minor) began at 29/0300 UTC, reached a peak flux of
15 pfu at 29/0320 UTC and ended at 29/0540 UTC associated with the aforementioned C9 flare
on 28 May.
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels on 24-26 May
and decreased to normal-moderate levels on 27-30 May. The largest flux of the period was 1,530
pfu observed at 25/1825 UTC.
Geomagnetic field activity ranged from quiet to G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm levels. The
period began with nominal solar wind conditions and quiet levels through early on 26 May. At
26/1148 UTC, an impulsive increase in solar wind speed from approximately 300-350 km/s was
observed with a simultaneous increase in total field from 3-8 nT, marking the arrival of a
possible conglomeration of CMEs from 22-23 May. Total field continued to increase to 16 nT
through early on 27 May while solar wind speed increased to 400-450 km/s. The geomagnetic
field responded with unsettled to G1 (Minor) storm levels the second half on 26 May, followed
by quiet to active levels on 27 May. Solar wind speed continued between 380-490 km/s through
the end of the period. Quiet conditions were once again observed on 28 May followed by quiet to
unsettled levels on 29-30 May.
Space Weather Outlook
31 May - 26 June 2021
Solar activity is expected to be at very low to low levels on 31 May - 11 Jun and again on 26 Jun.
A slight chance for moderate (R1-Minor) flares exist on 12-25 Jun with the return of Region
2824 to the visible disk.
No proton events are expected at geosynchronous orbit.
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit is expected to reach high levels on

Solar activity was at very low levels. An isolated C1 flare peaked at 09/0004 UTC just after the
reporting period from new Region 2853 (N23, L=192, class/area Axx/010 on 08 Aug). The
single spot just appeared late on 08 Aug but was preceded by an area of active plage which
rotated onto the visible disk on 06 Aug. No Earth-directed CMEs were observed.
No proton events were observed at geosynchronous orbit.
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels on 04-05 Aug
with a peak flux of 1,570 pfu observed at 05/1725 UTC.
Geomagnetic field activity ranged from quiet to G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming. An
enhancement in the IMF field began at 02/0900 UTC, likely from a glancing blow from the 28
Jul CME. Total field reached a peak of 13 nT at 02/1810 UTC, while the Bz component was
mostly negative for 1.5 days reaching -13 nT briefly 02/1815 UTC. Solar wind speed at this time
was between 300-400 km/s. The geomagnetic field responded with quiet to G1 storm levels on
02 Aug and quiet to active levels on 03 Aug. Quiet conditions were observed on 04 Aug through
late on 06 Aug. By the middle of 06 Aug, a likely CIR preceding a weak positive polarity
coronal hole high speed stream (CH HSS) was observed causing total field to increase to a
maximum of 13 nT at 07/0620 UTC along with a prolonged period of southward Bz to -9 nT.
Solar wind speed briefly increased to near 475 km/s on 07 Aug before declining to below 400
km/s by midday on 08 Aug. The geomagnetic field reached unsettled periods late on 06 Aug
through 07 Aug followed by quiet levels on 08 Aug.

14 November 2022
Solar activity was at low to high levels. Low levels were observed on 08-10 Nov and again on 13
Nov. Moderate levels occurred on 11-12 Nov due to M1 flare activity from Region 3141 (N14,
L=318, class/area Eki/610 on 11 Nov). These flares were an M1/1f at 11/0714 UTC, an M1/Sn at
11/1140 UTC, and an M1/Sf at 12/0018 UTC as well as a total of 41 C-flares. High levels
occurred on 07 Nov (reported on previous weekly) due to an M5 flare from Region 3141 at
07/0011 UTC along with an associated Type II radio sweep and a 740 sfu Tenflare. Region 3141
continued to exhibit growth through 11 Nov and developed into a beta-gamma-delta magnetic
class on 10-11 Nov before slowly decaying to near 270 millionths by 13 Nov. Region 3140
(N25, L=326, class/area Dai/230 on 13 Nov) began to exhibit growth and development of
trailing spots beginning on 11 Nov and was responsible for 12 C-flares. No Earth-directed CMEs
were observed during the reporting period.
No proton events were observed at geosynchronous orbit.
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels on 07 and
10-11 Nov due to weak transient activity. The peak flux was 9,400 pfu at 07/0925 UTC.
Geomagnetic field activity ranged from quiet to G1 (Minor) storm levels. Solar wind parameters
indicated a possible weak transient on 07-08 Nov. Total field increased to near 15 nT while the
Bz component deflected southward from approximately 07/0845-1745 reaching a maximum of
-15 nT. The geomagnetic field responded with quiet to G1 (Minor) storming on 07 Nov followed
by quiet to active levels on 08 Nov and quiet to unsettled levels on 09 Nov. Quiet conditions
were observed on 10 Nov under a nominal solar wind regime. On 11-13 Nov a weak, negative
polarity, CH HSS became geoeffective. Solar wind speed increased to near 490 km/s by midday
on 12 Nov. Total field increased to near 14 nT late on 11 Nov before declining to near 6-7 nT.

Solar activity ranged from very low to low levels on 22-24 Aug with a majority of the flare
activity originating from Region 3085 (S24, L=041, class/area Dko/280 on 25 Aug). Activity
levels picked up on 25 Aug with weak M-class (R1-Minor) activity recorded from Regions 3088
(S27, L=300, class/area Dkc/650 on 27 Aug) and 3089 (S23, L=196, class/area Eki/320 on 27
Aug). A further increase in activity was observed on 26 Aug with moderate flaring
(R2-Moderate) from Region 3089 in the form of an M7.2/1b flare at 26/1214 UTC.
27 Aug saw 4 M-class flares from Reg 3088, the largest an M4.8/Sf at 27/0240 UTC with
associated Type II (657 km/s) and Type IV Sweeps and a 130 sfu 10cm Burst. R2-Moderate flare
activity was then observed on 28 Aug in the form of an M6.7/Sf at 28/1619 UTC. Associated
with this event was a Type IV Sweep and a 1800 sfu 10cm Burst. Throughout the later half of the
highlight period, a variety of CMEs were seen lifting off the SW limb as observed in LASCO
and STEREO coronagraph imagery. Initial analysis and model output all suggested weak
glancing blow effects, if any, on 28-29 Aug.
The greater than 10 MeV at 10 pfu protons reached event levels (S1-Minor) this period as a
result of a long duration M1.2/Sn flare from Rgn 3088 observed at 27/1138 UTC. The proton
event started at 27/1155 UTC, peaked at 27/1220 UTC (27.5 pfu) and ended at 27/2145 UTC.
Proton background levels remained elevated at the the end of the highlight period.
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit was at high levels on 22-27 Aug
with a maximum flux reading of 4,360 pfu at 23/1455 UTC. Normal to moderate levels were
observed on 28 Aug.
Geomagnetic field activity was at quiet to unsettled levels through midday on 27 Aug under a
nominal wind environment. Unsettled to active levels were observed from midday on the 27th
through midday on the 28th due to an enhanced total field to 10 nT and increased wind speeds to
about 500 km/s, all due to a weak negative polarity CH HSS.
Space Weather Outlook
29 August - 24 September 2022
Solar activity is expected to be at mostly very low to low levels, with a chance for (R1-R2,
Minor-Moderate) flare activity, through 05 Sep after Rgn 3089 departs, and again from 11-24
Sep due to the return of old Rgns 3088 and 3089. Mostly very low to low flare activity is
expected on 06-10 Sep.

Solar activity reached moderate levels due to a long duration M1 flare observed at 29/2332 UTC
from Region 2936 (N17, L=116, class/area Ekc/720 on 30 Jan). Associated with this event was a
10cm (320 sfu) radio event and assymetric full halo CME, first visible in LASCO C2 imagery at
29/2336 UTC. Forecaster analysis/WSA Enlil modeling determined this CME to arrive at Earth
late on 01 Feb. Region 2936 also produced numerous (31) C-class flares. Regions 2939 (S15,
L=37, class/area Cso/120 on 30 Jan) and 2940 (N17, L=37, class/area are unkown due to
foreshortening at the east limb) also produced C-class activity during the period.
No proton events were observed at geosynchronous orbit during the highlight period.
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit reached high levels on 24 Jan due
to recurrent CH HSS influences. Normal to moderate levels were observed on 25-30 Jan.
Geomagnetic field activity reached active levels on 28-29 Jan due to influences from a positive
polarity CH HSS. Quiet to unsettled levels were observed on 24-27, and 30 Jan.
Space Weather Outlook
31 January - 26 February 2022
Solar activity is expected to be at very low to low levels, with a chance for islolated M-class
flares on 31 Jan - 05 Feb due to the flare potential from Region 2936 (N17, L=116, class/area

enhancements were observed on 01-02 Feb with total field at highs of 18 nT and the Bz
component reaching -17 nT at times. Wind speeds increased from about 410 km/s to about 750
km/s late on 01 Feb.
Space Weather Outlook
03 February - 01 March 2025
Solar activity is expected to be at R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) levels throughout a majority of the
outlook period, all due to numerous, significant solar regions expected on the solar disk.
No proton events are expected at geosynchronous orbit.
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit is expected to be at high levels on
03-04 Feb, 18-19 Feb, 27-28 Feb and 01 Mar, all due to CH HSS effects. Normal to moderate
levels are expected on 05-17 Feb and 20-26 Feb.
Geomagnetic field activity is expected to be at unsettled to active levels on 03-05 Feb due to a
combination of positive polarity CH HSS and weak CME effects. Unsettled to active levels are

Solar activity ranged from low to high levels (R1-R2/Minor-Moderate). High levels were
observed on 17 Jan following an M7.4 (R2) flare at 17/1335 UTC from Region 3964 (N06,
L=247, class/area=Dki/475 on 17 Jan). The region also produced ten R1 (Minor) events over
17-19 Jan. Region 3961 (S09, L=181, class/area=Eki/600) also produced an M1.1 (R1) flare at
17/0320 UTC. All other active regions were either quiet to contributed only C-class events. No
Earth-directed CMEs were observed in available coronagraph imagery.
No proton events were observed at geosynchronous orbit.
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit was normal to moderate levels.
Geomagnetic field activity was at quiet to active levels. Active conditions were reached on 13
Jan, 15 Jan, 17 Jan, and 19 Jan. Unsettled to quiet conditions were observed for the remainder of
the summary period. All elevations in geomagnetic activity were attributed to influence from
multiple, negative polarity CH HSSs.
Space Weather Outlook
20 January - 15 February 2025
Solar activity is likely to reach moderate levels (R1-R2/Minor-Moderate), with a chance for high
levels of activity (up to R3-Strong), throughout the outlook period. This potential is driven
primarily by Regions 3964 (N06, L=249, class/area=Dki/475 on 17 Jan) and 3961 (S09, L=181,
class/area=Eki/600 on 17 Jan) on the Earth-facing side of the Sun as well as multiple regions on
the Sun&#39;s farside that are due to rotated back onto the visible disk later during the outlook
period.
There is a slight chance for proton events of S1 or greater at geosynchronous orbit due primarily
to the flare potential from Regions 3964 and 3961 over 20-28 Jan.
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit is likely to be at high levels on
02-05 Feb due to recurrent CH HSS activity. The remainder of the outlook period is expected to
be at normal to moderate levels.
Geomagnetic field activity is expected to be at quiet to G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm levels. G1
conditions are likely on 31 Jan - 02 Feb, 11 Feb, and 13 Feb. Active conditions are likely on 20
Jan, 03-05 Feb, 10 Feb, 12 Feb, and 14-15 Feb. Unsettle levels are likely over 21 Jan, 06 Feb,
and 09 Feb. All elevations in geomagnetic activity are anticipated due to multiple, recurrent CH
HSSs. The remainder of the outlook period is expected to be at mostly quiet levels.
