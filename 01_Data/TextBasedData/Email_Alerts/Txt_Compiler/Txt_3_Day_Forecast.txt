Rationale: G1-2 (Minor-Moderate) geomagnetic storming is likely 10-11
May due to the arrival of CMEs that left the Sun over the course of
07-08 May.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

through the forecast period given the observed activity from AR 3664 in
particular.

Rationale: R3 (Strong) radio blackouts due to X-class flares are likely
through the forecast period primarily due to the magnetic complexity and
stature of AR 3634.

Rationale: G4 (Severe) levels occurred early on 11 Oct. G1-G3
(Minor-Strong) levels are expected for the rest of the UTC day due to
persistent CME activity. G1 (Minor) levels are expected on 12 Oct due to
residual CME activity and possible CH HSS.

Rationale: Active to G1 (Minor) storm levels are expected on 04-05 Jan
due to CME effects on 04 and 05 Jan and CH HSS effects on 05 Jan.

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was

Rationale: M-class flares (R1-R2/Minor-Moderate) are likely, with a
slight chance for isolated X-class flares (R3/Strong) through 05 Jan,
primarily due to the flare potential of Regions 3939 and 3945.

21-00UT       4.00         2.67         2.33     

Rationale: Isolated periods of G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming are
expected on 05 Jan, first due to lingering CME effects, then to positive
polarity CH HSS effects. More ambient conditions are likely on 05-06 Jan
as CH HSS influence persists.

Rationale: S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are currently
observed at the 10 MeV threshold. Radiation storms are expected to
continue into 05 Jan and decay to a chance on 06 Jan and a slight chance
on 07 Jan.

continue and Region 3947 continues to evolve.

Rationale: R1-2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts due to M-class flare
activity are likely through 05 Jan. Event probabilities increase
slightly on days 2 and 3 (04 & 05 Jan) as ARs 3938 (N16W61, Cao/beta),
3940 (S06, L=083), 3939 and 3946 (S10W62, Dao/beta) approach the western
limb.

Rationale: Solar activity is likely to reach moderate levels
(R1/R2-Minor/Moderate radio blackouts), with a slight chance for
isolated X-Class (R3-Strong) events, over 03 - 05 Feb, primarily due to
potential from an active region cluster in the Suns NE quadrant.

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Jan 20-Jan 22 2025

              Jan 20  Jan 21  Jan 22
S1 or greater   15%     15%     15%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for S1 (Minor) or greater solar
radiation storms over 20-22 Jan due to multiple complex regions on the
visible disk.


C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

R3 or greater   20%           20%           20%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely, with a
chance for R3 (Strong), over 20-22 Jan due to the flare potential
of multiple complex regions on the visible disk.

A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 24-Feb 26 2025 is 3.33 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

S1 or greater   10%     10%     10%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for the greater than 10 MeV proton
flux to reach S1 (Minor) storm levels over 24-26 Feb.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R3 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 23 2025 1927 UTC.

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) events are likely, with a slight
chance for R3 (Strong) or greater events, over 24-26 Feb.
