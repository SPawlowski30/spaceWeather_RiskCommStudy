Solar Activity


.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity was at low levels. The largest flare of the period was a
C3.9 at 15/0005 UTC from newly numbered Region 3998 (S14E67, Dao/beta).


Region 3992 (S06W68, Eao/beta-gamma) continued to show signs of decay in
its intermediate spots and was relatively quiet. After developing a
relatively mature penumbra on its leading spots, the trailing spots of
Region 3995 (S22W60, Cao/beta) completely decayed to plage. Region 3990
(S09W12, Cki/beta-gamma) appears to have stopped growing, but there is
still a decent amount of flux emergence and magnetic shear present. The
potential for a new, simple numbered region developed just ahead of AR
3990 as well, but remains unnumbered at this time as we await
corroborating observatory reports. Significant magnetic shear was also
present in Regions 3996 (S16E53, Eao/beta-gamma and 3997 (N03E29,
Cai/beta-gamma), which both exhibited slight growth. The remaining spot
groups were largely stable.


No Earth-directed CMEs were observed in coronagraph imagery this period.




.Forecast...
Solar activity is expected to be low with a chance for M-class (R1-R2,
Minor-Moderate) activity and a slight chance for X-class (R3, Strong)
activity through 18 Feb.


Energetic Particle


.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 4,740 pfu observed at 15/1530 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV
proton flux was at background levels.


.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is likely to remain at moderate
to high levels through early to mid 16 Feb and then return to normal to
moderate levels by 17 Feb. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is
expected to remain below S1 (Minor) levels through 18 Feb.


Solar Wind


.24 hr Summary...
Solar wind parameters were elevated under negative polarity CH HSS
conditions. Total field ranged 4-7 nT, while the Bz component was mostly
southward reaching -5 to -7 nT throughout the period. Solar wind speeds
ranged from ~540 km/s to ~660 km/s. Phi was predominantly negative while
undertaking excursions into a positive solar sector.


.Forecast...
The solar wind environment is expected to remain enhanced before
gradually weakening by 18 Feb due to influence from a recurrent,
negative polarity CH HSS. Additional disturbances are possible by late
16 Feb and again on 18 Feb due to any glancing or shock influence seen
from CMEs that left the Sun on 14 and 15 Feb, respectively.


Geospace


.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field reached G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming levels.


.Forecast...
The geomagnetic field is likely to reach G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming
levels on 16 Feb due to negative polarity CH HSS effects and possible
glancing influences from a CME that left the Sun on 14 Feb. Unsettled to
active levels are expected on 17 Feb as negative polarity CH HSS effects
continue and again on 18 Feb with any glancing influences from the
aforementioned 14/15 Feb CME events.

Solar Activity


.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity reached moderate levels. A new region just beyond the SE
limb produced an M1.2 flare at 14/0228 UTC. New spots in the vicinity of
this flare began to rotate into view late in the period, but remain
unnumbered at this time as we await corroborating observatory reports.
Region 3990 (S10E13, Dki/beta-gamma) continued to evolve as it gained
additional spots and maintained a mixed polarity configuration. AR 3990
was responsible for a M1.2 flare at 14/0948 UTC and a M1.8 flare at
14/2057 UTC, the latter of which was coupled with a type II radio sweep
with an estimated velocity of 941 km/s. However, we await imagery to
perform proper analysis of this event as of the time of this writing.
Region 3992 (S07W40, Eai/beta-gamma) continued to show signs of decay in
its intermediate spots and was relatively quiet this period.


Additionally, Region 3994 (S19W04 Dao/beta) produced a C6.6 flare at
14/0745 UTC. At approximately 14/0824 UTC a potentially subsequent,
southeasterly CME can be seen in LASCO C2 coronagraph imagery. However,
confidence is low that the entirety of this CME is associated with this
particular event and there may have been perhaps a far-side eruption in
frame as well. However, if the entirety of the CME is indeed
Earth-directed then modeling efforts suggest that a glancing blow is
possible by late on 16 Feb.


.Forecast...
Solar activity is expected to be low with a chance for M-class (R1-R2,
Minor-Moderate) activity and a slight chance for X-class (R3, Strong)
activity through 16 Feb.


Energetic Particle


.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 6,600 pfu observed at 14/1600 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV
proton flux was at background levels.


.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is likely to remain at moderate
to high levels through 15 Feb and then return to normal to moderate
levels by 16 Feb. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to
remain below S1 (Minor) levels through 16 Feb.


Solar Wind


.24 hr Summary...
Solar wind parameters were elevated under negative polarity CH HSS
conditions. Solar wind speed ranged from ~440 to ~570 km/s. Total field
ranged from 6-9 nT while the Bz component was between +/-9 nT. Phi angle
was predominantly negative.


.Forecast...
The solar wind environment is expected to be enhanced through 17 Feb due
to influence from a recurrent, negative polarity CH HSS. An additional
disturbance is possible by late 16 Feb due to any glancing or shock
influence seen from the aforementioned C6.6 flare event.


Geospace


.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field reached G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming levels.


.Forecast...
Isolated G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming periods are likely early on 15
Feb as negative polarity CH HSS effects continue. Unsettled to Active
conditions are expected on 16 Feb as CH HSS effects gradually begin to
wane. There is also a chance for G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming on 16
Feb with any glancing effects or shock from the aforementioned CME that
left the Sun on 14 Feb. Primarily quiet to unsettled conditions are
expected to prevail on 17 Feb as weakening CH HSS effects continue.

Solar Activity


.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity reached moderate levels due to an M1.2 at 14/0228 UTC
from a Region just beyond the SE limb near S17 and another M1.2 at
14/1006 UTC from Region 3990 (S10E15, Dki/beta-gamma). Slight decay and
separation was observed in the smaller spots of Regions 3990 and 3992
(S07W40, Dai/beta-gamma). Growth was observed in Regions 3994 (S19W04,
Dro/beta) and newly numbered 3995 (S22W30, Dro/beta). The rest of the
spot groups were relatively stable. No Earth-directed CMEs were
observed.


.Forecast...
Solar activity is expected to be low with a chance for M-class (R1-R2,
Minor-Moderate) activity through 16 Feb.


Energetic Particle


.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 2,430 pfu observed at 13/1620 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV
proton flux was at background levels.


.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is likely to remain at moderate
to high levels through 15 Feb and then return to normal to moderate
levels on 16 Feb. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to
remain below S1 (Minor) levels through 16 Feb.


Solar Wind


.24 hr Summary...
Solar wind parameters were elevated under negative polarity CH HSS
conditions. Solar wind speed ranged from 410-580 km/s. Total field
ranged from 5-9 nT while the Bz component was between +/-8 nT. Phi angle
was predominantly negative.


.Forecast...
The solar wind environment is expected to be enhanced through 16 Feb due
to influence from a recurrent, negative polarity CH HSS.


Geospace


.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field was at unsettled to active levels with an isolated
G1 (Minor) storm period early on 14 Feb.


.Forecast...
Unsettled to G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm levels are expected on 14 Feb
due to CH HSS activity. Unsettled to active levels are expected on 15
Feb as HSS effects persist with primarily quiet to unsettled conditions
prevailing by 16 Feb as effects begin to wane

Solar Activity


.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity remained at moderate levels (R1-Minor). Departing Region
3981 (N07, L=343) produced a single M1.6 flare at 11/0535 UTC as
well as the majority of C-class activity this period. Region 3990
(S09E54, Dko/beta-gamma) continued to expand in overall size and its
magnetic complexity is becoming more clear as it rotates further into
view. The remaining numbered regions were stable and quiet. A C7.2 flare
was observed at 11/1825 UTC associated with what appeared to be a
prominence eruption east of newly numbered Region 3991 (S12E70,
Hsx/alpha). A CME was visible in LASCO C2 imagery beginning at 11/1812
UTC. Model analysis will be conducted as more imagery comes in.


The two CMEs mentioned in the previous forecast were modeled and neither
are expected to be geoeffective.


.Forecast...
Solar activity is expected to be low with a chance for (R1-R2,
Minor-Moderate) activity on 12-14 Feb as AR 3981 continues to rotate
around the western limb.


Energetic Particles


.24 hr Summary...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux reached high levels with a peak
flux of 2,077 pfu observed at 11/1605 UTC. The greater than 10 MeV
proton flux was at background levels.


.Forecast...
The greater than 2 MeV electron flux is likely to remain at moderate
to high levels through 14 Feb. The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is
expected to remain below S1 (Minor) levels through 14 Feb as AR 3981
moves farther beyond the western limb.


Solar Wind


.24 hr Summary...
The solar wind environment was enhanced by negative polarity CH HSS
influences. Total field Bt remained mostly steady near 6 nT, while the
Bz component varied between +/-6 nT. Wind speeds slowly decreased from
and average of about 550 km/s to near 500 km/s during the period. Phi
was predominantly negative.


.Forecast...
A slightly enhanced and disturbed solar wind environment is expected on
12 Feb as influence from the current CH HSS begins to wane. However,
there is a chance for an additional enhancement by late 12 Feb due to
any glancing influences from a slow, faint CME that left the Sun on 08
Feb. Confidence is low in this outcome. Enhancement from a subsequent
negative polarity CH HSS is anticipated on 13-14 Feb.


Geospace


.24 hr Summary...
The geomagnetic field was at unsettled to active levels due to negative
polarity CH HSS influence.


.Forecast...
Quiet to unsettled conditions, with isolated active periods, are
expected 12 Feb as CH HSS effects continue along with a chance of
glancing influences from the aforementioned 08 Feb CME. G1 (Minor) storm
periods are likely on 13 Feb due to onset of a subsequent negative
polarity CH HSS. Unsettled to active conditions on 14 Feb as CH
influence continues.
