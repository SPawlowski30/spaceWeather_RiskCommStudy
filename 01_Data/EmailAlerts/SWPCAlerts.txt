Serial Number: 475
Issue Time: 2025 Feb 07 0916 UTC


ALERT: X-Ray Flux exceeded M5
Threshold Reached: 2025 Feb 07 0914 UTC
NOAA Scale: R2 - Moderate


NOAA Space Weather Scale descriptions can be found at
www.swpc.noaa.gov/noaa-scales-explanation


Potential Impacts: Area of impact centered on sub-solar point on the sunlit side of Earth. Extent of blackout of HF (high frequency) radio communication dependent upon current X-ray Flux intensity.
