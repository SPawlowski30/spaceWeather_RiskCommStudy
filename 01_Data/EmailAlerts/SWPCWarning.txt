Space Weather Message Code: WARK06
Serial Number: 560
Issue Time: 2025 Feb 15 1034 UTC


WARNING: Geomagnetic K-Index of 6 expected
Valid From: 2025 Feb 15 1030 UTC
Valid To: 2025 Feb 15 1500 UTC
Warning Condition: Onset
NOAA Scale: G2 - Moderate


NOAA Space Weather Scale descriptions can be found at
www.swpc.noaa.gov/noaa-scales-explanation


Potential Impacts: Area of impact primarily poleward of 55 degrees Geomagnetic Latitude.
Induced Currents - Power grid fluctuations can occur. High-latitude power systems may experience voltage alarms.
Spacecraft - Satellite orientation irregularities may occur; increased drag on low Earth-orbit satellites is possible.
Radio - HF (high frequency) radio propagation can fade at higher latitudes.
Aurora - Aurora may be seen as low as New York to Wisconsin to Washington state.
