Our analysis directory is subdivided into two main categories - NLP and numerical data analysis. Within NLP, we conduct sentiment analysis, term frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), and topic modeling. For our numerical analysis, we attempt to combine and simplify the NOAA space weather warning scale and generate a graph that displays a history of charging events so satellite operators can assess cumulative effects.
